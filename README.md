The `data-sad-psyctr` dataset is a meta-analytic research domain [MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf) which is part of the  [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of randomized trials on psychological interventions for social anxiety disorder. The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-sad-psyctr/blob/main/metadata/last_search.txt). More details about a larger version of this dataset can be accessed in the published [meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618524000574?via%3Dihub).

This dataset includes psychological interventions vs. control (`psy vs ctr`) comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for all validated social anxiety measures reported in a study at post-treatment, including clinician-rated instruments and self-report questionnaires (e.g., Social Phobia Scale, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, etc.). It includes one type of effect size calculation per study, giving priority to means and standard deviations at post-test. 
All data has been extracted by two independent reviewers.
Risk of bias assessments were performed by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (version 2).

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/).
